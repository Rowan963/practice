Book Catalogue CLI
A simple command-line application for managing a book catalogue. This script allows you to add, edit, search, and delete books, as well as view the entire catalogue. The data is stored in a pickle file (my_data.pickle), so your book collection is preserved between sessions.

Features
Add Books: Add new books to the catalogue with title, writer, and original title (optional).
Edit Books: Update the title, writer, or original title of existing books.
Search Books: Find books in the catalogue by title (case-insensitive).
Delete Books: Remove books from the catalogue.
View All Books: Print a list of all books in the catalogue.
